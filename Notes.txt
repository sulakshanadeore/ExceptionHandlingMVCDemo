Exeption Handling:

1) try-catch-finally
2) Overriding OnException method
Overwrites the OnException() which is a void method that takes argument as ExceptionContext object 
that has all information about the exception so that it could be logged to a file.
ExceptionHandled=true is necessary for the ExceptionContext object.
We can handle all the exceptions  generated from all the actions from that specific controller.

3) HandleError Attribute----> can't log the exception 
It doesn't catch httpexceptions  other than 500
It doesn't catch exception handled outside controller
And it returns error view for exceptions raised in Ajax calls

4) Global Exception handling filter- Handling Application_Error event
5) Custom Exception handling using HandleError[]----Most Used--because of reusablity
